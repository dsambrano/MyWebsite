        <div class = "blurb"><h3>“Motivational influences on perceptual judgments: How what we want changes what we see"</h3><p>As a Stanford Summer Research Early Identification Scholar (SR-EIP) I am conducting this research under the guidance of <a href = "http://web.stanford.edu/~ycleong/index.html">Yuan Chang Leong</a> and <a href = "http://ssnl.stanford.edu">Dr. Jamil Zaki</a>. We often proceed through our day erroneously believing that we see objective truth about our environment. Aside from obvious cases (e.g., visual illusions), we frequently ignore systematic biases in our judgements. For this project, we motivated individuals to alter their perceptual judgments in the random dot motion task. Currently, we are collecting data. <em>More information will be posted when available.</em></p></div>
        
        <div class = "blurb"><h3>“The Effects of Discrete Affective States on Information Processing Style, Judgment, and Decision Making"</h3><p>This project constitutes my Maximizing Access to Research Careers (<a href = "http://marc.fullerton.edu">MARC</a>) Scholar thesis and was conducted under the guidance of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iris_Blandon-Gitlin"> Dr. Iris Blandón-Gitlin</a>. Cognitive emotional interactions are ubiquitous. This projects tests the effects of sadness on information processing, decision making, and social judgments. Based on the feelings-as-information theory<sup class = "intextCite">[<a href="http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/hdbk_socialpsychtheories1/n15.xml">3</a>]</sup>, we hypothesize that individuals in a sad mood will engage in an analytic processing style, while individuals in happy and angry moods will engage in a heuristic-based processing style; in turn, these moods and processing styles will affect participants’ decisions and judgments in a similar pattern. Preliminary resutls support our hypothesis. <em>More information will be posted when available.</em></p></div>
        
        <div class = "blurb"><h3>“Emotion Regulation and Well-being: A Structural Equation Model"</h3><p>I completed this independent research project as a collaboration with <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kathleen_Preston"> Dr. Kathleen Preston</a>. Our emotions frequently fluctuate throughout the day. Due to these fluctuations, we occasionally find ourselves in a situation in which our current situation does not allow for our present emotional state; and therefore, we must regulate our emotions. Thus, appropriate emotion regulation is an important factor for social interactions and psychological well-being. Similarly, emotional intelligence, our ability to evaluate the present emotional context (i.e., understanding why our friends sad or why the person running towards you is angry) and react appropriately, aids us in navigating our social landscape. We proposed a model such that increased emotion regulation abilities and emotional intelligence improved psychological well-being, which in turn improves general life satisfaction. We are currently preparing a manuscript for publication. <em>More information will be posted when available.</em></p></div>

    <h1 class="research">Past Research Projects</h1>
        <div class = "blurb"><h3>“Exploring Differences in Posed and Genuine Emotional Expressions: A Facial Expression Database"</h3><p>I completed this thesis under the guidance of <a href="http://psych.fullerton.edu/jpeissig/">Dr. Jessie Peissig</a> as part of the requirement for the <a href = "http://www.fullerton.edu/mcNair/">McNair</a> Scholar's program. Historically, much of the previous research on facial expressions were conducted on posed expressions from actors. The purposed of this project was to create and validate a databased of genuine and posed expressions of the same individuals to be made freely available to researchers. Further, due to the numerous studies on other race effect, an additional goal was to collect stimuli from a diverse set of participants. The final database consists of approximately 400 valid facial expressions derived from 47 participants vary ethnic and gender backgrounds. Currently, we are preparing a manuscript for publication.</p></div>

        <div class = "blurb"><h3>“Juror Bias in Criminal Court Decision Making"</h3><p>The focus of this project, conducted by <a href="http://hssfaculty.fullerton.edu/psychology/ruespinoza/Index.htm">Dr. Russ Espinoza</a>, was to investigate juror biases. Due to jurors power to make verdicts, any biases they have about the defendant or plaintiff can have severe consequences. Specifically, this study examines how jurors’ political affiliation and their views towards the mentally ill influence verdict, sentencing, and perceptions’ of defendants’ culpability of mentally ill defendants. Data revealed partial support for our hypotheses; jurors’ political affiliation and their views towards the mentally ill influenced the jurors’ verdict and perception of defendants’ culpability but not their suggested sentence. </p></div>
