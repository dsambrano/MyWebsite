# Development

To-Do:
- [] Make the Explore Button on home page much bigger and animated both ease in as well as a subtle bounce probs. Maybe even put that in the middle and move name to bottom. 
- [] Make it so that the slide in animations do not occur unless they are visible (so the page does not have a left right scroll
- [] Make Dynamic and have on server.
