To-Do:
- [ ] Make the Explore Button on home page much bigger and animated both ease in as well as a subtle bounce probs. Maybe even put that in the middle and move name to bottom. 
- [ ] Make it so that the slide in animations do not occur unless they are visible (so the page does not have a left right scroll
- [ ] Make Dynamic and have on server. 
- [ ] Update UI: (rounded corners on main blurb, explore, and explore nav), reduce main content size ~70% instead of 80, explore nave smaller only about 30 percent also transparency with animation.
- [ ] Update Content: (research projects, collaborators add pual colin and hao [grid layout?]), pubs (with CV add poli sci and new pubs), about me add blog, main page update news and announcements, convert to static site so I dont have to replace so often?, research add comp modeling
